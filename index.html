            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Firstly, the typography tasks. I really enjoyed researching and learning about the different typographic systems. When making the 8 typographic designs, I found some more difficult than others, but in the end, I was able to make 8 different unique designs that follow the different criteria. The one I found most challenging was the ‘Random’ typographic system. This wasn’t because I had a lack of skills in InDesign, but I found it very difficult to come up with a design. This is because the ‘random’ typographic system doesn’t have the most specific criteria to follow, so you can kind of do what you want. However, in the end I was able to come up with a design that I feel is good enough. The one that I enjoyed creating the most is the ‘transitional’ typographic system, this is because I felt I could be a lot more creative, and the design is a lot more unique.<br><br>
            I found the CARP task very enjoyable as I felt I could be very creative with it. I also found it very easy to stick the criteria given (contrast, alignment, repetition and proximity), and was able to include everything stated in each of the posters. This was my first ever time using InDesign, so it took me a while to get used to and how to work it. But after some research I was able to learn a couple tips and tricks to make productivity and efficiency a lot easier when using the software. The final poster was definitely my favourite as it looks a lot more unique and also the most professional out of all the posters I made. The second one I made is my least favourite. I am still proud of it and think it looks good, but I feel like it’s the most basic and plain out of all the posters I made.<br><br>
            The worksheets I found very good for my progression of learning how to use HTML and CSS. The worksheets were very thorough and in depth which really helped me. I got through them with relative ease and managed to complete them all without much trouble.<br><br>
            And finally, the website. I really enjoyed constructing my website and I found it quite challenging which I thought made it more enjoyable. I had made some previous websites before using HTML and CSS but nothing overly complicated. I feel like this was a lot harder than any other websites I made before as there was more to the website and the work was a lot more independent than when I made a website before. I am really proud with the outcome and thought it came out very well. I feel like it is easy to navigate through and looks fairly professional.<br><br>
            Overall, I found the assignment relatively challenging and time consuming, however I really did enjoy designing and creating my website. Along the way I did find some parts difficult and did run into some hurdles, but I was able to solve them through thorough research and developing my skills.<br><br>
