    <h1>Typography Tasks</h1>


    <main>
        <div class="container-navigation">

            <div class="typ1"><img src="typography/typo1.png" alt="Typography 1" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Axial</h4>
                <p>I really enjoyed creating this image, after some 
                    thorough research I was able to come up with a design
                    in my head that I think has come out very well. Axial means
                    that it all has to be inline with an axis but can be 
                    symetrical or asymetrical. So I thought it would be cool
                    to mix up the colours or each side of the axis.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ2"><img src="typography/typo2.png" alt="Typography 2" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Radial</h4>
                <p>I found this one slightly more difficult to make as it was 
                    hard lining everything up off of the circle. However, once it 
                    was complete I thought it turned out very well. Radial means that 
                    you need to pick a central focal point where the text comes off,
                    I thought I incorparated this very well in my design.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ3"><img src="typography/typo3.png" alt="Typography 3" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Dilatational</h4>
                <p>Once figuring out how to correctly curve the text on a line, I found 
                    this design relitvley easy to make. I really enjoyed making this one 
                    as I felt I could be a lot more creative with my design. Dilatational is 
                    different from radial, rather than radiating out from a point, the text 
                    forms a curve around a point. I believe I executed this design very well, 
                    and thought the outcome was good.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ4"><img src="typography/typo4.png" alt="Typography 4" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Random</h4>
                <p>This one I found a lot more tricky to come up with a design for, as with 
                    the random typographic system literally means what it says. Theres no specific
                    rules or alignment, which means you can do pretty much whatever you want. As 
                    a result I came up with an intresting design. I do not think it is the most
                    aesthetically pleasing desing, but that could just be because of my taste in art.
