    <h1>Typography Tasks</h1>


    <main>
        <div class="container-navigation">

            <div class="typ1"><img src="typography/typo1.png" alt="Typography 1" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Axial</h4>
                <p>I really enjoyed creating this image, after some 
                    thorough research I was able to come up with a design
                    in my head that I think has come out very well. Axial means
                    that it all has to be inline with an axis but can be 
                    symetrical or asymetrical. So I thought it would be cool
                    to mix up the colours or each side of the axis.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ2"><img src="typography/typo2.png" alt="Typography 2" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Radial</h4>
                <p>I found this one slightly more difficult to make as it was 
                    hard lining everything up off of the circle. However, once it 
                    was complete I thought it turned out very well. Radial means that 
                    you need to pick a central focal point where the text comes off,
                    I thought I incorparated this very well in my design.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ3"><img src="typography/typo3.png" alt="Typography 3" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Dilatational</h4>
                <p>Once figuring out how to correctly curve the text on a line, I found 
                    this design relitvley easy to make. I really enjoyed making this one 
                    as I felt I could be a lot more creative with my design. Dilatational is 
                    different from radial, rather than radiating out from a point, the text 
                    forms a curve around a point. I believe I executed this design very well, 
                    and thought the outcome was good.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ4"><img src="typography/typo4.png" alt="Typography 4" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Random</h4>
                <p>This one I found a lot more tricky to come up with a design for, as with 
                    the random typographic system literally means what it says. Theres no specific
                    rules or alignment, which means you can do pretty much whatever you want. As 
                    a result I came up with an intresting design. I do not think it is the most
                    aesthetically pleasing desing, but that could just be because of my taste in art.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ5"><img src="typography/typo5.png" alt="Typography 5" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Grid</h4>
                <p>The grid typographic system pretty much explains itself in the name, it uses
                    grids, this can be in whatever way you want. Usually this would be used for 
                    posters, books, essays, etc. However, I have used the system and made a piece
                    of work that I think is aesthetically pleasing and a lot less boring than 
                    what you would see in a book or an essay.

                </p>

            <div class="typ6"><img src="typography/typo6.png" alt="Typography 6" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Modular</h4>
                <p>People tend to confuse the modular system with the grid system. However, 
                    when using the modular system there is no need to use a grid. Instead it uses 
                    repeating shapes to break up the content. I really enjoyed making this one and 
                    I feel like it came out very well.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ7"><img src="typography/typo7.png" alt="Typography 7" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Transitional</h4>
                <p>Transitional designs are very natural looking and flowy. The text tends to 
                    all follow in one direction but its more natural and flowy looking. I think 
                    my design came out very well as it meets all the specifications of the 
                    typographic system, whilst also looking aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="typ8"><img src="typography/typo8.png" alt="Typography 8" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Bilateral</h4>
                <p>The bilateral typographic system is quite a boring design. This is because 
                    the system tends to revolve around the text being centered and symetrey. 
                    Despite this I tried to make the design as fun and as interesting as possible 
                    whilst still trying to follow the specifications of the bilateral system.
