                <p>This worksheet was very straight foward, I'm not surprised 
                    it was very easy as it was the first worksheet that was just 
                    getting us used to using visual studio code and coding in HTML. 
                    It didnt make anything amazing as it literally just displayed 
                    the message written between the 'P' tags. <br>Despite that I 
                    feel like this task definatley helped when getting to grips 
                    with visual studio code as I had never used it before.

                <p>I found these weeks very intresting and helpful as it really developed my 
                    skills and what I am capable of doing with HTML and CSS. It tought me how 
                    to make lists, center text, add images and lots more useful skills that 
                    would help when building a website. I didn't find anything overly complicated 
                    or confusing as the steps on the worksheets where very helpful.<br>
                    Overall these tasks where very useful and really boosted my confidence when 
                    using HTML and CSS.

                <p>These final weeks on the worksheets, 4 and 5, where very useful as I learnt 
                    how to use flexbox. This is very useful as it makes a website look so much 
                    more professional with very little extra code. I also learnt how to make buttons, 
                    which is obviously a very important skill when building a website as it helps 
                    users to navigate to other pages or parts of a page where you want them to go to.
                    In addition to this I also added a video in the page which I thought looked really 
                    good and again makes a website look a lot more professional.<br><br>
