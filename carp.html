        <p>With this first poster I was trying
            to focus on proximity, as I feel it is 
            important in a poster as it makes it a 
            lot easier for the user to read and 
            understand. That being said I still wanted
            to make it look unique, whilst also 
            incorparating contrast, alignment and 
            repetition at the same time. I feel like I
            did achieve this with this poster.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="carp2"><img src="photos/CARP2.png" alt="CARP 2" width="297px" height="420px">
        <p>With the second poster I wanted to make it very simple and basic
            as it would make it easy for people of all age groups to understand.
            That being said I still wanted the poster to look professional at the
            same time, I feel like I achieved this and it came out very well. I also
            still managed to include all the factors stated within the task.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="carp3"><img src="photos/CARP3.png" alt="CARP 3" width="297px" height="420px">
        <p>The last poster I wanted to be diffent and a lot more unique, thats why
            I went with this abstract look. I really like this poster as I feel 
            like it would catch the users eye more than any other poster I made.
            It also includes contrast, alignment, repetition and proximity. I feel
            like this poster does it best compared to my other posters.
